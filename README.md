# üëã Hi there
I'm Lucas Ribeiro, a passionate software developer and tech enthusiast. I currently work as a Senior Software Developer FullStack.

With over 18 years of experience in the field, I've had the opportunity to work on various exciting projects and explore different technologies since enterprise systems with which I worked for several years, such as consulting SAP, to the dynamic world of startups.

# üöÄ Expertise
With over 18 years of technology experience and 5 years dedicated to Full-Stack Development, I have honed a versatile skill set and a deep understanding of various technologies.

My expertise lies in designing and implementing solutions on the BigCommerce ecommerce platform, employing a component-based architecture using Angular, React, and Vue.js/Vuex.js.

I have a robust background in back-end technologies, including Node.js/Express.js and PHP frameworks such as Laravel and CodeIgniter.

Outside of the professional environment I dedicate myself to my family and my son where we create comics together in the best `George Beard` and `Harold Hutchins` style from `Captain Underpants` written by `Dav Pilkey`
